main.rs:
    - creates new instance of server and calls run function

server.rs:
    - struct: contains an IP address
    - fn run: 
        - creates tcp listener and binds to server's address
        - listens for requests
        - on successful request, stream containing request is read into buffer and printed
        - on error, error is printed

http:
    - method.rs: contains method enum (GET, POST, DELETE, etc)
    - request.rs: 
        - contains request struct (path, query_string, method)
        - contains custom error types and conversions from buffer to request pieces
    - mod.rs: bundles up method and request submodules under http module


Result type returns Ok(...) or Err(...)
Option type returns Some(...) or None(...)

Semicolon implies not returning thing

#![...] applies attribute to document
#[] applies to preceding thing (derive(Debug allows us to us debug on Request type))

Deriving Copy and Clone allows you to turn make a stack copy of a heap allocated value (need it to debug/print status codes)

Static Dispatch: used to make response.send function generic over all types that the send function is called on (creates new
function versions for each type at compile time)

Traits allow you to define shared behavior and customize across specific use cases
